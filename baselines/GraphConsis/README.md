## Brief Introduction

It is revised based on the [GraphSage](https://github.com/safe-graph/DGFraud/tree/kay-tf2/algorithms/GraphSage) model. We support multiple relations and distance sampling as mentioned in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00625.pdf).


## Run the code
Go to `algorithms/GraphConsis/`, and run the following command in the terminal:

`python GraphConsis_main.py `

or run `GraphConsis_main.py` in your IDEs.

## Note
- Before running the code, please remember unzip the given dataset.

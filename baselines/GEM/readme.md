## Brief Introduction

A heterogeneous graph neural network approach for detecting malicious accounts.

## Input Format

This model uses a device graph as input. We use a small example graph in our toolbox. You can find the example graph structure in **load_example_gem** function in `\utils\dataloader.py`. If you want to use your own graph as the input, just follow the same format like the example graph.
